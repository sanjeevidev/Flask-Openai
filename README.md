# Flask-Openai
This is a Flask application that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 model for text generation based on user input prompts. The application allows users to enter a prompt and receive a generated text response.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenAI Python library

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the code files.

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```
pip install flask openai
```

3. Obtain an API key from OpenAI by creating an account and subscribing to the GPT-3 service. Replace `__YOUR-OPEN-API-KEY__` in the code with your actual API key.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application locally by executing the following command in the project directory:

```
python app.py
```

2. Access the application in a web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Enter a prompt in the provided input field and submit the form.

4. The application will generate a text response based on the prompt using the OpenAI GPT-3 model and display it on the page.

## Important Note

Please note that the code provided here assumes you have a valid OpenAI GPT-3 API key. Ensure you have proper authorization and follow any usage guidelines provided by OpenAI.

It's also recommended to review the OpenAI documentation to understand the capabilities and limitations of the GPT-3 model.
